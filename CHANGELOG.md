# Changelog
## 3.0-SNAPSHOT6
- Rewrote plugin from scratch. Source code is now muuuuch cleaner and faster
- Unload/dump now works with chests, double chests, shulkerboxes and barrels
- /dump will no longer take items from the player's hotbar
- InvUnload can use ChestSort to sort chests that have been affected by unloading/dumping. This can be disabled in the config and only works if the player has automatic chest sorting enabled
- Particle types and sound effects can be set in the config.yml
